#+TITLE: evil-snipe Layer

This is my own configuration/customization of evil-snipe with spacemacs, as I
don't like how the layer that comes with spacemacs works.

Basically I want evil-snipe to provide the functionality of [[https://github.com/dahu/vim-fanfingtastic][vim-fanfingtastic]],
which lets =f=, =F=, =t=, and =T= work across multiple lines, but without the
other bits of functionality that normally come with it.

* Installation

I think the easiest thing to do is just put this whole project inside of the
=private= directory inside of your =.emacs.d=, but I'm not well-versed in
spacemacs convetions or idioms.

#+BEGIN_SRC 
git clone <this url> ~/.emacs.d/private/evil-snipe
#+END_SRC

This will replace the default =evil-snipe= layer. Then add =evil-snipe= to the
configured layers in your =.spacemacs= to load it.
